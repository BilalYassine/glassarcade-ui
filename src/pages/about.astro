		<h2 class="mx-4 text-[1.5em] lg:text-[2em] lg:mx-32 mt-8">Glass Arcade is two friends who love video games. 
			We have been playing games together since we met in high school.  
			Since 2019 when we started our first project together, we have been learning 
			and practicing everything that goes into making a video game; the design, art, code, and music.  
			Glass Arcade is our journey towards turning our passion into a living - we hope you will join us on our journey.  </h2>
