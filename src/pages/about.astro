				<p class="p-4"> Hi friends! I have a background in technology consulting where I spend time 
					doing project management, product, and tech strategy for ecommerce sites.  While I enjoyed the 
					work and learned a lot, I have always felt drawn to video game design.  More than anything, I just love
					creating things; I think expressing our creativity in whatever way we feel called is one of the coolest
					things about being human.  As a co-founder of Glass Arcade, I am excited to continue bringing my ideas to life 
					to create memorable games for all.
