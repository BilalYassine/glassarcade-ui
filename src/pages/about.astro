		<h2 class="text-[1.5em] lg:text-[1.5em] mt-8">We're two friends who have been playing games together since we met in high school.  
			For years, we've been learning 
			and practicing what goes into creating the experiences we've loved.  
			With Glass Arcade, we're turning our passion into a living - join us on our journey!  </h2>

				<h3 class="pt-4">Meet Rob</h3>
				<p class="p-4">I have loved playing video games since I got my first GameCube at 7 years old.  At that time, I would tell people I wanted to be an artist when I grew up.
					  I have always loved making things and turning my ideas into reality.  For me, designing and developing games has served as the perfect creative outlet; in the same way that I love getting lost in the immersion of a hand crafted
					  world, I now love getting lost in creating them for others.  As a Co-Founder of Glass Arcade, I am excited to continue bringing my ideas to life 
					  through the creation of memorable and exciting gaming experiences. <br>
					  <br>
					  While I could list inspiring games forever, my favorite indie games are Outer Wilds, Hades, Ori, Celeste, Dead Cells, and Baba Is You.

					I'm a storyteller at heart with a passion for games - I feel like I've been writing stories and building worlds in my head since I was a kid. I really resonate with the idea that stories are the common ground that we can all connect on.
					<br>
					<br>
					With a professional background in software engineering, I'm finally pursuing my dream of becoming a game developer to blend my love for art and storytelling into immersive experiences. I'm also eager to use this as an opportunity to really grow as an aspiring animator and digital artist to cultivate our own unique style in our games.
					I'm wildly excited to take this leap & embracing the world of art and storytelling in its most engaging form.

					Shout-out to some of my favorite games that I've been playing a lot of recently: Dave the Diver, Civilization 6, Doom: Eternal, Cuphead, Baldur's Gate 3, Hollow Knight, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
